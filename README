ISSUE
Sometimes I have to support about 10 projects for company customers. So locally
I have docker with containers for each project and I was tired to type every 
time long path to a project and run `docker-compose ...`. Moreover sometimes I
can forget wich project is active and run it one more time... Eventually I disided
to create some simple wrapper for docker-compose to control this process.

DESCRIPTION
Console tool that helps to up and down local projects via docker-compose.

INSTALL & USAGE (for Linux)
Create `projects.json` based on `projects.json.example`.

Run for help:
$ python main.py -h
